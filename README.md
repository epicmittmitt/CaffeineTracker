### Instructions

This app is pretty self-explanatory. Take a picture of the beverage you wish to consume, and the app will pull caffeine stats from the internet and log them to a journal.

The app also tracks how much caffeine is in your system and can tell you when the effects of the drug should wear off.

**Note:** these numbers *will* very from person to person. The numbers used in the app are generalizations at best. This app cannot - and does not aim to - replace a medical professional. Use at your own discression.

We hope you enjoy it!
